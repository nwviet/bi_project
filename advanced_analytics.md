**Key Questions:**
  - Should the focus be on revenue growth or order volume?
  - How can the company leverage accessories for additional revenue?

- This project focuses on predicting customer demand for bicycle products using historical sales data.
- Bikes generate the most revenue (96.46%) with over 20,000 orders in 2013, totaling over 16 million USD.
- Key metrics for analysis are number of orders and revenue.
- Customer Demand Trends:
- Overall business trend is increasing revenue year-over-year.
  - 2011: Slow increase (peak daily revenue $55K)
  - 2012: Decrease (peak daily revenue $25K)
  - 2013: Increase (peak daily revenue $100K)
- Top 3 Subcategories (2013)
  - Mountain Bikes: Stable and expected to grow the most (reach $22K/day)
  - Road Bikes: Slower growth, expected to reach $20K/day
  - Touring Bikes: Fastest growing, expected to reach $20K/day (revenue increase of 4x in 1 year)
- Orders vs. Revenue:
  - Highest revenue product (Bikes) is not the most ordered product.
  - Accessories have the highest number of orders (e.g., tires, tubes, bottles).
  - Sales and order forecasts are nearly identical, suggesting a proportional relationship.
